## 🔧 Key Design Decisions

### Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM** - Chosen for type safety and excellent TypeScript integration
- **Many-to-many relationships** - Posts can have multiple categories
- **Cascade deletes** - Removing posts automatically cleans up category relationships

### API Design
- **tRPC** - Provides end-to-end type safety from database to frontend
- **Zod validation** - All inputs are validated at the API level
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error messages and graceful failures

### UX Decisions
- **Immediate publishing** - Posts are published when "Save Post" is clicked
- **No-redirect deletion** - Posts disappear from homepage without navigation
- **Hover interactions** - Edit/delete buttons appear on hover for clean UI
- **Category creation during post creation** - Streamlined workflow

### Performance Optimizations
- **Connection pooling** - Optimized database connections for Neon
- **Efficient queries** - Single queries with joins to minimize database round trips
- **Static generation** - Pages are pre-rendered where possible
